/*** Project 2: Hashing ***/

/* Birthday Attack 1
 *
 * 10 Points
 *
 * In this problem, you will implement a birthday attack on a simple hash function that is provided
 * in the header file. The goal will be to find a collision in the hash function using the Birthday 
 * Attack (with at least a 50% chance of success).
 *
 * Assumptions
 * - The hash function will have a 16 bit output (2 bytes). We will use the `unsigned short` type
 *   as the output type to make things simple.
 * - The hash function will take `unsigned integers` as input, again to make things simple.
 * - Your function will output:
 *     (a) two inputs a and b such that h(a) = h(b) (a collision), as a list [a, b], or 
 *     (b) {} if no collision is found.
 *   The output type of the function will be `vector<unsigned int>`.
 *
 * Algorithm Description
 * - Do the following a small constant number of times (at least 2):
 *     - Randomly generate 350 unsigned integers. Feel free to use the provided helper function
 *       `sample_int()`.
 *     - For each of the generated integers:
 *         - Hash the integer
 *         - Check if you find a collision. If yes, you can stop and output the two colliding inputs.
 * - If no collision is found, output {} (an empty list).
 *
 * Hash Function Signature
 *   unsigned short test_hash(unsigned int input);
 *

/* Birthday Attack 2
 *
 * 10 Points
 *
 * In this problem, you will implement a slightly different birthday attack on a simple 
 * hash function that is provided in the header file. The birthday attack described in 
 * part 1 above has the drawback of potentially needing too much space to implement
 * (proportional to sqrt(hash_output_domain_size)). You will address this in this
 * problem.
 *
 * The birthday-type attack you will implement in this problem is known as "Floyd's
 * tortoise and hare algorithm" (which is actually just a cycle finding algorithm).
 * We'll use it to implement a small-space birthday attack.
 *
 * Assumptions
 * - The hash function will have a 16 bit output (2 bytes). We will use the `unsigned short` type
 *   as the output type to make things simple.
 * - The hash function will take `unsigned integers` as input, again to make things simple.
 * - Your function will output two inputs a and b such that h(a) = h(b) (a collision), as a list [a, b].
 *
 * Algorithm Description
 * - Maintain two values, `tort` and `hare`, initialized as 
 *   tort = hash(0) and hare = hash(hash(0)).
 * - While tort != hare, take "one-step" with tort and "two-steps" with hare.
 *   This means updating tort by hashing the previous value of tort once, and hare
 *   by computing the double hash of the previous value of hare (see the initialization
 *   as an example).
 * - Once tort == hare, reset tort = 0.
 * - Now, while hash(tort) != hash(hare) take "one-step" with
 *   both tort and hare, until hash(tort) == hash(hare).
 * - Output [tort, hare]
 *
 * Additional Resources
 * - The following lecture notes explain both birthday attack algorithms:
 *      https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~davidcash/284-autumn-21/12-hash.pdf
 *
 * Hash Function Signature
 *   unsigned short test_hash(unsigned int input);
